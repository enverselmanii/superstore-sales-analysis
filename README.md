# Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data from a Superstore dataset to identify profit trends, loss-driving categories, and provide actionable business insights using Python.  
The main goal is to explore sales and profit performance across different product categories and sub-categories, and to visualize key trends for business decision-making.

The project is created for **educational purposes and portfolio demonstration only**.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: **Superstore Sales Dataset**.  

**Important:** The CSV file is **not included** in this repository.  
Place the dataset locally on your machine and update the `DATA_PATH` variable in the notebook accordingly (e.g., `C:\datasets\superstore.csv`).  

This ensures the project is safe for GitHub and avoids copyright issues.
